### **Reflective Statement - Problem Solving Module**

Throughout the Problem Solving module, I have developed several skills that will not only support me academically but also enhance my professional career. The activities and challenges presented during this module helped me improve both my technical abilities and interpersonal skills.

#### **Skills Developed**

One of the primary skills I developed was my ability to **analyze and solve complex problems**. I learned to break larger problems into smaller, more manageable components, which allowed me to better understand underlying causes and identify appropriate solutions. Moreover, I honed my proficiency in using **programming tools**, such as [C, Python, or any language you worked with], allowing me to write more efficient scripts to tackle the problems presented.

#### **Self-Awareness: Strengths and Weaknesses**

During this module, I realized that I excel under pressure and am quite effective at **managing tight deadlines**. I can prioritize tasks efficiently and maintain focus on short-term goals without losing sight of the overall objective. However, I also discovered that my **time management** needs improvement, especially when dealing with multiple projects simultaneously. I often spend more time than necessary on smaller tasks, which impacts my performance on more complex activities.

#### **Areas for Improvement and How to Address Them**

A key area I need to improve is **time management**. To address this, I plan to adopt techniques like the **Pomodoro Method**, which breaks time into 25-minute blocks with short breaks in between. Additionally, I will start using task management tools, such as **Trello** or **Todoist**, to better visualize my tasks and allocate my time more effectively.

#### **Monitoring Progress and Identifying Improvements**

Throughout the module, I continuously monitored my progress by reviewing completed tasks and the feedback I received. One useful technique was **self-assessment** after each completed task, where I identified areas for improvement in future work. For example, after the first few evaluations, I realized I needed to pay closer attention to the assessment criteria, which significantly improved the quality of my subsequent submissions.

#### **Time Management and Balancing Multiple Tasks**

Managing my time was especially challenging as I balanced this module with other academic projects and assignments. Using a weekly schedule was crucial for distributing my workload and ensuring I had enough time to complete the tasks with proper attention to detail. However, there were moments when I could have planned better, allocating more time for reviewing my work before submission.

#### **Changes to Previous Assessments**

If I were to change something about one of the previous assessments, I would revisit **Assessment 4** (replace with the assessment that applies), where I did not allocate enough time for thorough testing of my code. To improve, I would have dedicated more time to **unit testing** and **validating results**, ensuring that my solution was robust before submitting it.

**Conclusion**

The Problem Solving module has been incredibly beneficial for both my academic and personal development. I have learned to reflect on my progress, identify areas for improvement, and plan for future growth more effectively. I look forward to applying the lessons learned in future modules and in my professional career.
